| P0-03 | License, provenance and sensitive-file scan | Scan report lists every incompatible and sensitive item with a replace/never-copy decision | ☑ |

## P1 — Folder Skeleton and Governance Files (Milestone M1.1)

| ID | Task | Done when | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1-01 | Folder layout from §B4.3 and §C7.1 | Tree matches §B4.3 and §C7.1 exactly | ☑ |
| P1-02 | License update (Apache-2.0 → AGPL-3.0-only), CLA, REUSE | LICENSE is AGPL-3.0; no Apache text left; reuse lint passes | ☑ |
| P1-03 | Project docs | Each file matches its plan section | ☑ |
| P1-04 | .github files (written, not pushed) | Files exist and match §B12.7 and §C5.8 | ☑ |
| P1-05 | ADRs 0001–0018 | 18 ADRs, status accepted | ☑ |
| P1-06 | Provenance record | Every §B14 row has a provenance entry (status: planned) | ☑ |

## P2 — Tooling and Local CI (Milestone M1.2)

| ID | Task | Done when | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2-01 | Backend project | uv run pytest and uv run mypy app pass on the skeleton | ☑ |
| P2-02 | Frontend project | npm run build and npm test pass | ☑ |
| P2-03 | Makefile (single entry point) | make verify passes on the skeleton | ☑ |
| P2-04 | Check scripts | Each script fails on a bad sample and passes on the skeleton | ☑ |
| P2-05 | Pre-commit and local secret scan | Hooks run on a local commit | ☑ |
| P2-06 | CI workflow files (dormant) | Every workflow parses (actionlint) and each job maps to a make target | ☑ |

## P2b — Identity and secrets foundation: Zitadel and OpenBao as config (before P3)

| ID | Task | Done when | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P2-07 | OpenBao server from config | OpenBao starts from the HCL config, initializes, unseals by the runbook and reports healthy. | ☑ |
| P2-08 | OpenBao as code: engines, policies, AppRole | A second `make openbao-apply` reports no changes; each AppRole can read only its own paths. | ☑ |
| P2-09 | Zitadel self-hosted (official compose) | Zitadel console reachable at the configured domain; credentials came only from OpenBao. | ☑ |
| P2-10 | Zitadel as code: project, roles, apps | A second `make zitadel-apply` reports no changes; a test sign-in gets a JWT with project roles. | ☑ |
| P2-11 | Multi-organization in Zitadel | Two orgs from config; each signs in only to its own AssetFlow organization. | ☑ |
| P2-12 | Startup wiring and smoke test | Smoke test passes from a clean machine; a sealed OpenBao stops AssetFlow with a clear error. | ☑ |

## P3 — Bootable Backend, Web Shell and Minimal Stack (Parts of M1.3, M1.6)

| ID | Task | Done when | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P3-01 | Config loader | Invalid config stops boot with an exact path; tests cover it | ☐ |
| P3-02 | Database access and first migration | Migration check passes; isolation test passes; upgrade->downgrade->upgrade works | ☐ |
| P3-03 | Errors, envelope, IDs | Every error class maps to a code in the generated reference | ☐ |
| P3-04 | Provider interfaces and registry | A dummy provider is selected by config; contract test skeleton runs | ☐ |
| P3-05 | App factory and health | API starts locally and health returns every provider's state | ☐ |
| P3-06 | Web shell and compose.minimal | make up-minimal shows the web shell calling the health API | ☐ |

## P4 — Port Inventory for Master Phase 2

| ID | Task | Done when | Status |
