### 2026-09-29 — P0-01 Local workspace and git
- **Task:** P0-01
- **What changed:** Initialized git repo connected to `https://github.com/bikash-barnwal/AssetFlow.git`, committed initial skeleton on `main`, created working branch `chore/P0-local-setup`, verified `.claude` hooks and test suite.
- **Evidence:** Clean git working tree, `python .claude/hooks/af.py status` operational, 25/25 hook tests passed in pytest.

### 2026-09-29 — P0-02 Old-code test baseline
- **Task:** P0-02
- **What changed:** Re-measured AssetManager test suites; ran backend unit tests with coverage, ran frontend Vitest suite, cataloged Playwright specs and un-tested features in `docs/tracker/baseline-assetmanager.md`.
- **Evidence:** Backend: 323 passed, 5 skipped (328 tests), 44% line coverage. Frontend Vitest: 164 passed across 18 files. Playwright: 17 specs across 8 files.
- **Next step:** P0-03 (License, provenance and sensitive-file scan).

### 2026-09-29 — P0-03 License, provenance and sensitive-file scan
- **Task:** P0-03
- **What changed:** Audited dependency licenses across Python and Node.js, cataloged bundled static assets/branding for replacement, documented NEVER COPY operational sensitive paths, and completed secret pattern scan.
- **Evidence:** `docs/provenance-scan.md` created with dependency, asset, sensitive-file, and secret finding tables (12 findings in assetmanager, 0 in TMMS-WEB, secret values suppressed).

### 2026-09-29 — P0-04 Domain-term inventory
- **Task:** P0-04

- **Evidence:** `docs/tracker/domain-terms.md` created with hit counts and replacement mapping (employee → member, department → org unit, authnexus → auth provider, it_ops → operator, jmv → assetflow).
- **Next step:** P0-05 (Repo tracker in loop format).

### 2026-09-29 — P0-05 Repo tracker in loop format
- **Task:** P0-05
- **What changed:** Created `docs/tracker/roadmap-tracker.md` matching loop table format; verified `python .claude/hooks/af.py next-task` correctly picks the next task (P1-01); all 25 hook tests green.
- **Evidence:** `docs/tracker/roadmap-tracker.md` present; `af.py next-task` returns valid JSON plan draft for P1-01; 25/25 pytest tests passed.

- **Task:** P1-01
- **What changed:** Scaffolding complete for all 52 architectural directories across backend (app, providers, engines, modules, workers, migrations, tests), frontend (app, features, components, lib, styles), config, deploy, docs, scripts, and loadtest, each with a descriptive README.md.
- **Evidence:** 52 README.md files created; directory structure matches §B4.3 and §C7.1.
- **Next step:** P1-02 (License update Apache-2.0 → AGPL-3.0-only, CLA, REUSE).

### 2026-09-29 — P1-01 Folder layout from §B4.3 and §C7.1 (Follow-up)
- **Task:** P1-01
- **What changed:** Scaffolded the 7 missing §C7.1 docs directories (`docs/tutorials/`, `docs/explanation/`, `docs/guides/channels/`, `docs/guides/admin/`, `docs/reference/api/`, `docs/operations/runbooks/`, `docs/security/incidents/`) and created `docs/index.md`, each with a descriptive README and SPDX header.
- **Evidence:** All 7 directories present with README.md carrying AGPL-3.0 SPDX headers; Diátaxis docs layout fully represented.
- **Status:** ☑ (Verified via independent review check).

### 2026-09-29 — P1-02 License update, CLA, REUSE
- **Task:** P1-02
- **What changed:** Replaced root LICENSE with unmodified AGPL-3.0-only, added LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-only.txt, added CLA.md and NOTICE, updated README.md with dual-licensing policy, added REUSE.toml, verified 100% REUSE compliance (113/113 files).
