## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Tooling & local CI (P2-01 to P2-06)**: backend project (uv, FastAPI stub, ruff, mypy strict, pytest, import-linter contracts); frontend project (Vite, React 19, strict TypeScript, ESLint with jsx-a11y, vitest); Makefile with `make verify` as the single local gate; check scripts (domain terms, migration lint, contribution guardrails, license allowlist, docs links); pre-commit and commitlint; CI workflows (ci, security, contribution checks, CLA, scorecard, dependabot).
- **Identity & secrets (P2-07 to P2-12)**: OpenBao from HCL config with policies, KV v2, transit and AppRole applied by `scripts/openbao-apply.py`; self-hosted Zitadel with one-command setup (`scripts/bootstrap.sh`, `setup.bat`) and the idempotent `scripts/bootstrap_zitadel.py`: project, roles, apps, automation user, one Zitadel organization per `config/organizations/*.yaml` with project grants; startup order and smoke test.
- **Guides**: `docs/guides/setup-zitadel.md` and `docs/guides/setup-openbao.md`.

### Changed
- Zitadel configuration moved from OpenTofu to the bootstrap script (master plan decision 53).
